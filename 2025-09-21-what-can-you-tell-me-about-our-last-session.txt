       847    
       848 -  ### 🏗️ NEXT SPRINT: Complete Feature Enforcement
       849 -  **Priority**: High - Complete the feature management system implementation
       848 +  ### 🔴 CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES
       849 +  **Priority**: URGENT - Must be addressed immediately
       850    
       851 -  1. **Test improved feature enforcement** with new user-friendly names and 
           - navigation separation
       852 -  2. **Implement route-level protection** for disabled feature pages 
           - (middleware or page-level checks)
       853 -  3. **Add feature checking to settings subpages** (storage, profile, 
           - household management sections)
       854 -  4. **Connect upsell dialogs to subscription upgrade flow** (integrate with
           -  payment processing)
       855 -  5. **Test enforcement modes across different households and users** 
           - (comprehensive testing)
       856 -  6. **Optimize performance of feature checking service** (consider Redis 
           - caching for production)
       857 -  7. **Add unit tests for permission resolution logic** (test hierarchical 
           - override system)
       858 -  8. **Implement user override persistence** (create user_overrides table 
           - and API)
       859 -  9. **Add mobile testing for feature enforcement** (ensure navigation works
           -  on all devices)
       860 -  10. **Create admin documentation** for feature management workflows
       851 +  1. **ROTATE API KEYS**: API keys exposed in .env.local file need immediate
           +  rotation
       852 +  2. **FIX AUTHORIZATION**: meal-planner API uses service role key bypassing
           +  RLS - needs proper user validation
       853 +  3. **SECURE ENDPOINTS**: Implement proper authentication checks on all API
           +  routes
       854    
       855 +  ### ✅ COMPLETED IN THIS SESSION (January 22, 2025)
       856 +  - Fixed meal planner date handling with proper week calculations
       857 +  - Implemented attendance and guest management features
       858 +  - Added drag-and-drop functionality for meal reorganization
       859 +  - Created meal details dialog with recipe integration
       860 +  - Fixed recipe grid layout issues (multiple iterations to resolve)
       861 +  - Resolved database VARCHAR constraints blocking barcode scanning
       862 +  - Added pantry scorecards with ingredient availability tracking
       863 +  - Implemented mobile-friendly accordion displays
       864 +  - Fixed "September 14th" date generation bug
       865 +  
       866 +  ### 🏗️ NEXT SPRINT: Meal Planner Enhancement
       867 +  **Priority**: High - Complete remaining meal planning features
       868 +  
       869 +  1. **Meal History Integration**: Track and display previously cooked meals
       870 +  2. **Shopping List Generation**: Create shopping lists from meal plans
       871 +  3. **Nutritional Information**: Display nutrition facts for meals
       872 +  4. **Recipe Scaling**: Adjust recipes for different serving sizes
       873 +  5. **Ingredient Substitutions**: Suggest alternatives for missing items
       874 +  6. **Meal Plan Templates**: Save and reuse favorite meal plans
       875 +  7. **Family Preferences**: Track and learn from meal ratings
       876 +  8. **Leftovers Tracking**: Manage and suggest leftover usage
       877 +  
       878    ### 🎯 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
       879    - **Subscription tier integration**: Connect feature tiers to actual 
             payment plans
       880    - **Advanced analytics implementation**: Build the reporting features that
              can be toggled
       881    - **White-label customization**: Enterprise branding and configuration 
             options
       882    - **API rate limiting**: Implement the API usage controls defined in admin
              settings
       883    - **Mobile app feature parity**: Ensure all admin controls work in mobile 
             interface
       884 +  - **Recipe image handling**: Better fallback mechanisms for missing images
       885 +  - **Performance optimization**: Index optimization for search queries
       886 +  - **Touch device testing**: Verify drag-and-drop on tablets and phones

       891 -  **Last Updated**: September 15, 2025 (Major Admin Dashboard & Feature 
           - Enforcement Update)
       890 +  ## Technical Notes from Session
       891 +  
       892 +  ### Database Migration Strategy
       893 +  When changing column types with dependent views:
       894 +  1. Drop all dependent views CASCADE
       895 +  2. Alter column types to TEXT for flexibility
       896 +  3. Recreate views with correct column mappings
       897 +  4. Always use conditional checks for column existence
       898 +  
       899 +  ### Grid Layout Solution
       900 +  After extensive testing with MUI Grid components:
       901 +  - Grid2 component not available in current MUI version
       902 +  - Use `Grid size={{ xs: 12, sm: 6, md: 4 }}` syntax for responsive layouts
       903 +  - Container width adjustments may be needed for proper rendering
       904 +  
       905 +  ### Date Handling Best Practices
       906 +  - Use date-fns for all date manipulations
       907 +  - Never mutate date objects directly
       908 +  - Use `startOfWeek` with `weekStartsOn: 0` for Sunday start
       909 +  - Proper date generation without mutation prevents indexing errors
       910 +
