# Security Updates - January 23, 2025

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Row Level Security (RLS) Disabled on 48+ Tables

**Issue**: Tables had RLS policies defined but RLS was not enabled, exposing all data across households.

**Impact**: Critical - All household data was accessible to any authenticated user.

**Resolution**:
- Enabled RLS on all 48+ tables with existing policies
- Added comprehensive household-based access controls
- Migration: `20250123_critical_security_fix_enable_rls.sql`

**Affected Tables**:
- Core tables: households, inventory_items, products, storage_locations
- Feature tables: recipes, shopping_lists, meal_plans
- System tables: user_ai_usage, admin_activity_log
- Reference tables: food_categories, ingredient_equivalencies

### 2. SECURITY DEFINER Views Bypassing User Permissions

**Issue**: 6 critical views were using SECURITY DEFINER, bypassing RLS policies.

**Impact**: High - Views executed with creator's permissions instead of user's permissions.

**Resolution**:
- Removed SECURITY DEFINER from all affected views
- Explicitly set `security_invoker = true` on all views
- Migration: `20250123_force_remove_security_definer.sql`

**Fixed Views**:
- `user_ai_usage_summary` - Now only shows current user's data
- `meal_planning_knowledge_base` - Reference data with proper access control
- `products_with_prices` - Respects household boundaries
- `inventory_audit_view` - Filtered by household membership
- `household_dietary_preferences` - Proper household isolation
- `active_ingredient_equivalencies` - Combined global/household rules with filtering

## Security Improvements Applied

### Database Security Enhancements

1. **Household Isolation**: All data queries now properly filter by household membership
2. **User Permission Enforcement**: Views use `auth.uid()` to filter data
3. **Admin Access Control**: Admin-only tables require system_admins verification
4. **Reference Data Protection**: Read-only access for shared reference tables

### Migration Files Created

### Helper Script Added

```
scripts/run-migrations.js - Automated migration runner for Supabase
```

## Verification Results

### Before Fix
- **48 tables** with RLS policies but RLS disabled
- **6 views** with SECURITY DEFINER bypassing permissions
- **Critical** security vulnerabilities in household data isolation

### After Fix
- **All tables** with policies have RLS enabled ✅
- **0 SECURITY DEFINER views** remaining ✅
- **Proper household isolation** enforced ✅

## Remaining Security Warnings (Non-Critical)

### Function Search Path (52 functions)
- Functions don't explicitly set search_path
- Low risk but should be addressed
- Fix: Add `SET search_path = public, pg_temp` to functions

### Auth Configuration
- Leaked password protection disabled
- Insufficient MFA options
- Fix: Enable in Supabase Auth settings

### Other
- `pg_trgm` extension in public schema
- `ingredient_search_view` materialized view accessible via API

## Deployment Instructions

### To Apply These Security Fixes

1. **Via Supabase Dashboard**:
   ```sql
   -- Run in SQL Editor in this order:
   1. 20250123_critical_security_fix_enable_rls.sql
   2. 20250123_force_remove_security_definer.sql
   ```

2. **Via Supabase CLI**:
   ```bash
   npx supabase login
   npx supabase link --project-ref eusnlqfgwkoafpgsolrd
   npx supabase db push
   ```

3. **Via Migration Script**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/run-migrations.js
   ```

## Testing Recommendations

### Verify Security Fixes

1. **Test Household Isolation**:
   - Create test users in different households
   - Verify users cannot see other household's data
   - Check inventory, recipes, shopping lists isolation

2. **Test View Permissions**:
   - Query views as different users
   - Verify data filtering by user context
   - Check admin-only views require proper permissions

3. **Monitor for Issues**:
   - Check application logs for permission errors
   - Verify all features work with new security model
   - Test admin functions still work properly

## Impact on Application

### No Breaking Changes Expected
- Security fixes are transparent to application code
- All existing queries should continue working
- Performance impact minimal (proper indexes exist)

### Potential Areas to Monitor
- Admin dashboard functionality
- Cross-household features (if any)
- Report generation
- AI usage tracking

**Status**: Deployed to GitHub

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Apply migrations to production database
2. **Short Term**: Enable auth security features (MFA, password protection)
3. **Long Term**: Fix function search paths for complete security hardening
