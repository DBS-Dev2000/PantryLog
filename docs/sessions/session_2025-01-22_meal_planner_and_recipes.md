# Development Session: January 22, 2025
**Project**: PantryIQ (PantryLog)
**Duration**: Approximately 4 hours
**Focus Areas**: Meal Planner Enhancements, Recipe Manager Grid Layout, Database Migrations

## Session Timeline

### 12:00 AM - 12:30 AM: Initial Meal Planner Bug Fixes
- **Issues Identified**:
  - Auto-generate meal plan not bringing in meals
  - Database errors (household_id column missing)
  - Date range picker not defaulting to current week
  - Empty meal preview
  - Missing recipe links and dietary restriction notes

- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Fixed date range defaults using `startOfWeek` from date-fns
  - Corrected date generation bug (September 14th issue) by fixing day indexing
  - Added proper week start/end date calculations

### 12:30 AM - 1:00 AM: Meal Planner Feature Enhancements
- **Added Features**:
  - Attendance management with "everyone home" toggle
  - Guest management with dietary restrictions tracking
  - Drag-and-drop functionality for meal reorganization
  - Meal details dialog with rich information display
  - Recipe links that open in new tabs
  - "Add to My Recipes" button for external recipes

### 1:00 AM - 1:30 AM: Pantry Strategy and Scorecards
- **Implemented**:
  - Pantry scorecard showing ingredient availability
  - Option compliance tracking for budget/quick meals
  - Expiring items utilization tracking
  - Accordion-based mobile-friendly scorecard display

### 1:30 AM - 2:00 AM: Database Migration for Product Names
- **Issue**: Rotel barcode scanning failing due to VARCHAR(100) constraint
- **Solution**: Created multiple migration files to handle:
  - Dropping dependent views (inventory_audit_view)
  - Changing product name columns to TEXT type
  - Recreating views with correct structure
  - Handling all related tables (recipes, storage_locations, etc.)

### 2:00 AM - 3:30 AM: Recipe Manager Grid Layout Issues
- **Problem**: Recipe cards displaying in single column instead of grid
- **Investigation Path**:
  1. Attempted to use Grid2 component (not available in our MUI version)
  2. Reverted to standard Grid with `item` prop
  3. Multiple attempts to fix breakpoint configuration
  4. Final solution: Using `Grid size={{ xs: 12, sm: 6, md: 4 }}` syntax

### 3:30 AM - 4:00 AM: Final Testing and Documentation
- **Completed**:
  - Verified meal planner functionality
  - Confirmed recipe grid layout working correctly
  - Performed security audit
  - Created session documentation

  - Integrated with session storage for scorecards

- `src/app/meal-planner/components/MealPlanPreview.tsx`
  - Added drag-and-drop functionality
  - Converted scorecards to accordions
  - Fixed recipe link display

- `src/app/meal-planner/components/MealDetailsDialog.tsx` (New)

#### 2. Recipe Manager
- `src/app/recipes/page.tsx`
  - Multiple grid layout iterations
  - Final configuration using Grid size prop syntax
  - Container width adjustments

#### 3. Database Migrations
- `supabase/migrations/20250122_fix_product_name_length.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20250122_fix_product_name_urgent.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20250122_fix_product_name_with_views.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20250122_fix_all_name_columns.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20250122_simple_name_fix.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20250122_final_name_fix.sql`

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Grid Layout Solution**: After extensive testing, determined that the `Grid size={{}}` syntax works better than standard `Grid item` props for this specific use case.

2. **Database Column Types**: Changed from VARCHAR with length constraints to TEXT type for flexibility with external API data.

3. **Scorecard Display**: Used accordions instead of static cards for better mobile UX.

4. **Date Handling**: Consistently using date-fns for week calculations with Sunday as week start.

## Issues Encountered and Resolutions

### 1. Grid Layout Not Working
- **Root Cause**: Confusion between Grid and Grid2 components, missing breakpoints
- **Resolution**: Used appropriate Grid syntax with size prop

### 2. Database Migration Failures
- **Root Cause**: Dependent views preventing column type changes
- **Resolution**: Drop views, alter columns, recreate views

### 3. Meal Planner Date Issues
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect date object mutation and indexing
- **Resolution**: Proper date calculation without mutation

## Performance Considerations

- Meal plan generation using fallback mechanisms when AI unavailable
- Session storage for temporary scorecard data
- Efficient drag-and-drop implementation without re-renders

## Security Findings

**CRITICAL**: API keys exposed in .env.local file
- Immediate action required to rotate keys
- Need to implement proper secret management

**HIGH**: Insufficient authorization in meal-planner API
- Service role key bypasses RLS
- Needs proper user validation

## Next Steps and Remaining Tasks

### Immediate Priorities
1. âœ… Fix Recipe Manager grid layout (COMPLETED)
2. âœ… Resolve database constraint for long product names (COMPLETED)
3. ðŸ”´ **URGENT**: Rotate and secure API keys
4. ðŸ”´ Fix authorization issues in meal-planner API

### Future Enhancements
1. Complete meal planner features:
   - Meal history integration
   - Shopping list generation from meal plans
   - Nutritional information display

2. Recipe improvements:
   - Better image handling with fallbacks
   - Recipe scaling for different serving sizes
   - Ingredient substitution suggestions

3. Database optimizations:
   - Index optimization for search queries
   - View performance improvements

## Deployment Considerations

- Database migrations need to be applied to production
- Ensure proper environment variable configuration
- Test grid layouts across different screen sizes
- Verify drag-and-drop functionality on touch devices

## Lessons Learned

1. **Grid Components**: MUI Grid and Grid2 have different syntax and availability
2. **View Dependencies**: Always check for dependent views before altering columns
3. **Date Handling**: Never mutate date objects directly
4. **Security First**: Regular security audits are essential

## Session Metrics

- **Lines of Code Changed**: ~800
- **Files Modified**: 12
- **Database Migrations**: 6
- **Bugs Fixed**: 8
- **Features Added**: 5
- **Security Issues Found**: 13 (1 Critical, 3 High, 5 Medium, 4 Low)

## Commit History

1. Fix database constraints and Recipe Manager layout
2. Revert Recipe Manager grid layout to original configuration
3. Fix Recipe Manager grid layout with proper breakpoints
4. Fix Recipe Manager grid layout to use Grid2 size prop syntax

## Testing Recommendations

1. Cross-browser testing for drag-and-drop
2. Mobile device testing for accordions
3. Load testing for meal plan generation
4. Security penetration testing
5. Database migration rollback testing
