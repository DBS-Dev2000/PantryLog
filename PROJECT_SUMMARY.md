```
Default Enforcement Mode: "upsell" | "hide"
Default API Limits: {
  monthly_limit: $5.00,
  daily_limit: $1.00,
  free_tier_requests: 10
}
Global Settings: {
  show_upgrade_prompts: true,
  enforce_feature_limits: true
}
```

#### 🏠 **Household Level (Override System)**
```
Feature Toggles: {
  recipes_enabled: boolean,
  ai_features_enabled: boolean,
  shopping_list_sharing: boolean,

                     household.enforcement_mode ||
                     system.enforcement_mode,

    enforce_api_limits: user.overrides?.enforce_api_limits ??
                       household.enforce_api_limits ??
                       system.enforce_api_limits,

    unlimited_ai: user.overrides?.unlimited_ai || user.is_admin,

    feature_access: user.is_admin ? ALL_FEATURES :
                   calculateFeatureAccess(user, household, system)

## 🚧 Current Development Sprint

### **Sprint Goal**: Complete Feature Enforcement Implementation
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks
**Priority**: High (needed for subscription model effectiveness)

#### **User Stories**

**US-101: Feature Enforcement**
```
As a household admin
I want disabled features to be hidden or show upgrade prompts
So that I can control what my household members see and use
```

**US-102: Navigation Control**
```
As a user with limited features
I want to only see available features in navigation
So that I don't get confused by features I can't use
```

**US-103: Upsell Experience**
```
As a user clicking on a disabled feature
I want to see an attractive upgrade prompt
So that I understand the value and can upgrade if desired
```

### **Technical Tasks**
1. **Create Feature Service** (`/lib/features.ts`)
   - Query user's household features
   - Resolve hierarchical permissions
   - Cache feature checks for performance

2. **Implement Route Guards** (`/middleware.ts`)
   - Check feature access before page load
   - Redirect to upsell page or 404 based on mode
   - Handle API endpoint protection

3. **Update Navigation Component** (`/components/AppLayout.tsx`)
   - Dynamic menu generation based on features
   - Hide/show navigation items
   - Add upgrade indicators for disabled features

4. **Create Upsell Overlay** (`/components/FeatureUpsell.tsx`)
   - Reusable upgrade prompt component
   - Feature-specific messaging and pricing
   - Integration with subscription system
